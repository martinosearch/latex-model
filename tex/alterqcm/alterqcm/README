A. Purpose

The 'alterqcm' package is a LaTeX2e package, for making Multiple Choices Questionnaires

 The documentation is in French.

B. Features
 -- A special environment allows you to define questions and possible answers;
 -- You can specify which answers are correct and which are not.
 -- works with utf8 and pdflatex and xelatex;
 -- allows to use 'longtable';
 -- makes automatically adjustment;
 -- generates a 'grid' that the students will have to fill in;
 -- generates a 'mask' with correct answers to print a slide.
